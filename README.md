I'm a student and I was interesting in programming since I was young. I'm curious about everything around me and as long as I can learn and study, I will do that. I have good self learning ability, huge knowledge about life & outside world. I'm a talkative and funny person as well. If people are nice with me, then I will be nice with them too :) Why not? I also want to help and being helpful to others if possible.

My experience? I study most of thing by myself from reading book, searching Internet and surfing StackOverFlow. I specialise in web dev, the Javascript ecosystem, agile working, project specification and planning, testing, automation and web-related devops. I'm comfortable with tricky tasks and more creative/UX related work.
